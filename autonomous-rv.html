        <h2 class="title-2">CHALLENGE</h2>
          <p>The concept of self-driving cars is becoming a reality. We were asked to pick an autonomous vehicle type and take into account factors such as safety, trust, control, and efficiency, and then come up with a set of imaginative designs that speak to these new vehicles and address their issues. <strong>For this project, my team decided to focus on projected issues that may arise in self-driving RV’s.</strong> </p>

        <p id="note"><em><strong>*For this project, one person was asked to switch from their original team to another team.</strong> Upon being onboarded into another group and design focus, it was my responsibility to get caught up with the literature surrounding RV’s, my group’s research insights, their design process, and team dynamics. <strong>This primary research was conducted before I joined this group. When I arrived, we used this research to define a problem space.</strong></em></p>
        <p><strong>My team began with a preliminary round of research to identify motivations of RV owners. They interviewed RV owners, campground staff, and RV salesman.</strong> They engaged in open-ended conversations about user’s motivations and experiences with RV's and encouraged participants to share stories from previous trips. The goal for primary research was to peel back layers to identify why people buy and drive RV's.</p>

        <p>My team and I approached three RV drivers for our concept testing. We firstly described the context of self-driving cars and RV’s in the future and then explained the concept of a view/control interface for assurance. We presented rough sketches of both the screen and mobile version for users to evaluate which platform would work best with their needs.</p>

        <p>For this project, we were constrained for time. For this reason we <strong>designed</strong> control options and interactions <strong>only 
        for the weather alert</strong>. Our concept testing revealed what users would do in hazardous weather conditions. We created flows based on these <strong>two options:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Pull Over</strong> - The user can request the autonomous RV to pull over until hazardous weather conditions pass. 
          </li>

          <li><strong>Go To</strong> - One of the closest locations to the RV. Passengers in the RV can stop at one of these locations until hazardous weather conditions pass. Once the location is selected, the RV drives passengers towards that location.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Users also have the capability to take control and drive the autonomous RV if they feel the need to.</p>

          <p>We conducted our usability test on a male who has been a passenger in a self-driving Tesla multiple times, and contrarily an undergraduate female  who claims she is not tech savvy. We first provided the context of self-driving RV’s to users, and then the context of where the embedded system would fit into an RV. <strong>Through a paper prototype, each user was provided with a task to complete upon entering into the weather alert.</strong> When the screen changed through an interaction, the user was asked to reflect on what they thought just happened.</p>

          <p>For each user, we recorded their responses/painpoints for each task. <strong>After the usability test, we went back and asked both participants how they think each painpoint could be redesigned so that it was more usable.</strong> Taking the user’s suggestions into consideration, we translated each painpoint to an actionable item for redesign.</p>

          <h3>1. Communicate through sketching.</h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 20px;">There were moments where it was difficult for us as a team to express our individual ideas. Sometimes ideas were undermined because they were not communicated clearly. We made it a habit to always be sketching our thoughts or drawing on a whiteboard. Consequently, our process was more efficient and our thoughts were expressed clearly. </p>

          <h3>2. Translate insights into actionable design.</h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 20px;">It helped to create a chart that lists research insights in one column, and in another column list how those insights can be incorporated into our design. This ensures the design is molded by research, and that every design decision is backed with a rationale. </p>

          <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Through both our concept testing and usability testing, we asked users for recommendations of features they’d want to see and ideas for building a user-friendly interface. Getting feedback from participants took out a lot of ‘guessing’ what would be best for the end-user.</p>

          <h3>4. Don't take all research findings for face value.</h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 20px;">In our usability testing, we found our user's painpoints and suggestions for improvements towards usability. We quickly updated our design to reflect their suggestions. In hindsight, we could have questioned the 'why' behind our insights, why the user suggested what they did, if their suggestions fit into our design, and if there are other options to improve usability in that area. Before acting on research, question the results.</p>
